# With OpenRouter configured (v3.0.0):
#   - Uses EMBEDDING strategy for semantic link selection during crawling
#   - Semantic re-ranking of crawled pages
#   - Better results for non-English queries (Chinese, etc.)
#
# Without OpenRouter:
#   - Falls back to BM25 statistical strategy (keyword-based)
#   - Still works but may miss semantically relevant links
