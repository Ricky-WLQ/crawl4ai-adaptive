# Recommended: OpenAI API Key for EMBEDDING STRATEGY
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/
#
# EMBEDDING STRATEGY (v3.4.0) - When OPENAI_API_KEY is set:
#
# 1. EMBEDDINGS (FREE - no API cost!):
#    - Uses LOCAL sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
#    - Runs on the server, no API calls needed
#    - Calculates semantic similarity between query and links
#
# 2. QUERY EXPANSION (uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini):
#    - Generates variations of your query
#    - Example: "drug laws" -> ["narcotic regulations", "controlled substances", ...]
#    - Improves coverage of relevant content
#    - This is why we need OpenAI API key (chat model, not embedding model)
#
# Without OpenAI key:
#   - Falls back to BM25 statistical strategy (keyword-based)
#   - May miss relevant content that uses different terminology

# Optional: OpenRouter API Key for re-ranking phase
# Get your API key from: https://openrouter.ai/
# Model used: qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b
#
# RE-RANKING PHASE (optional, improves quality):
#   - After crawling, re-ranks pages by semantic similarity
#   - Uses OpenRouter embeddings for high-quality scoring
#   - Helps surface the most relevant content
#
# Without OpenRouter:
#   - Uses crawl scores only (still works, just less accurate)

# Optional: Server port (Zeabur sets this automatically)
